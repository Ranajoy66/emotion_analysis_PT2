  <h1>About Mind Space</h1>
  <p>
    Mind Space was created as a gentle digital companion — a place where
    emotions can be explored without judgment, pressure, or noise.

  <h3>🌿 Our Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    In a fast-moving world, emotional reflection is often neglected. Mind Space
    uses artificial intelligence to help individuals understand emotional
    patterns in a calm and structured way. It is not here to diagnose — it is
    here to encourage awareness.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>🧠 How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    Through guided questions and natural language analysis, our system evaluates
    emotional indicators such as anxiety, sadness, anger, and more. Results are
    visualized clearly, helping users recognize trends in their emotional state.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    Emotional clarity begins with self-awareness. Technology should support
    reflection — not replace human care.
